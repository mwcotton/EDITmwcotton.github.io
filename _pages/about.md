I am a DPhil candidate interested in the organisation and control of living systems.

Currently, my research focuses on theoretical modelling of biological membranes and I am supervised by [Prof Alain Goriely](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/alain.goriely) and [Prof Ramin Golestanian](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/golestanian). I am also grateful to be part of the [Interdisciplinary Biosciences DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department for Living Matter Physics](https://www.ds.mpg.de/lmp) at MPI-DS, GÃ¶ttingen.
