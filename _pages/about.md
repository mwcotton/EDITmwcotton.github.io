I am a researcher interested in the organisation and control of living systems.

My PhD was supervised by [Prof Alain Goriely](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/alain.goriely) and [Prof Ramin Golestanian](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/golestanian). I was also grateful to be part of the [Interdisciplinary Biosciences DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department for Living Matter Physics](https://www.ds.mpg.de/lmp) at MPI-DS, GÃ¶ttingen.
