I am a researcher interested in the organisation and control of living systems, currently based in the [group of Prof Sir David Klenerman](https://www.klenermangroup.co.uk/).

My PhD was supervised by [Prof Alain Goriely](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/alain.goriely) and [Prof Ramin Golestanian](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/golestanian). I was also grateful to be part of the [Interdisciplinary Biosciences DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department for Living Matter Physics](https://www.ds.mpg.de/lmp) at MPI-DS, GÃ¶ttingen.
<!-- G&ouml;ttingen.  -->

Some of my work is listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iC-3ZZsAAAAJ&hl=en). Please email me (mwc38 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk) to get in touch.
